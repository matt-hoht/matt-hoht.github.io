    Collaborative work in travel itinerary planning can be seen as inconvenient for many, however, there are many benefits in being able to work together on a travel plan. We have created surveys and interviewed people who often travel for leisure and asked them what their habits are in planning trips on their own as well as with a group of friends. This system is designed to help make collaborative travel itinerary planning more available by including functions such as bookmark system, live-editing to create an organized itinerary. Search functions and recommendations are incorporated for users to expand their itinerary.

        Introduction:
      </h2>
      <br>
      <b1 class=noto>
        Traveling to a foreign county is what college students dream of doing. However, they often underestimate the work behind planning a trip. There is an overwhelming amount of research and planning prior to going on a trip. It is time consuming for anyone to do such work. The sheer amount of information gathered for a trip becomes cluttered and unorganized especially when you have done your research using different materials such as travel guides, websites and the word of mouth from your peers. It becomes even harder when you want to coordinate and plan a trip with a group of people.

        How can we create an easy-to-use organized and informative travel itinerary especially when traveling as a group?

        Research & Assumption
      </h2>
      <br>
    <b2 class=noto>
        We had a few initial assumptions on travel planning and have listed them below and hopefully create a tool that addressed these assumptions.<br>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Having to go through different sites are tedious.</li>
          <br>
          <li>One person in a group does all the planning during travel.</li>
          <br>
          <li>People have difficulties to begin research when they don't know where to begin.</li>
          <br>
          <li>They have narrowed down some criteria on how they planned the trip, trying to cut cost to make it more affordable, experiencing the lifestyle and cultures of the places they visit, and having the freedom of going to places that they really would like to go.</li>


        </ul>
        <br>
        We then conducted personal interviews and published online survey on travel planning strategies, time it takes to conduct research, habits and behavior of people who often go on trips. And some of our assumptions are proven wrong. Our research shows that:
        <ul>
          <br>
          <li>We are able to find out that when it comes to planning as a group for friends, usually one person does the majority of the planning by taking in suggestions of what the people in the group enjoys doing. This often leads to arguments during the trip especially if the person planning did not strike a balance on going to places that caters to the group.</li>
          <br>
          <li>People enjoy using a variety of methods to conduct research and they enjoy visiting multiple travel websites.</li>
          <br>
          <li>People enjoy going to places their friends recommend over what the internet suggests.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Foreign public transport system is confusing.</li>
          <br>
          <li>People prefer freedom over schedule.</li>

                        We created a travel itinerary application that enables research and organization function. It allows for you and your group of friends and be able to participate in the planning and contribute into the organization of an itinerary. People can access and edit the itinerary in real-time and provide information about other nearby attractions and means of traveling.

                      <li>Ask our client to see what problems they want to solve and come up with a solution.</li><br>

                    Overall, I have realized the importance of market research in design. The topic of traveling is really broad. In the beginning of this project I felt like there were so many aspects of travel planning that can be improved. Finding out the problems of our audience by asking them about their struggles with the topic help narrowing down to the problem that needs to be solved. It is informative to have the mindset of what function would I like to have to solve my problem when researching existing products on the market. I strive to continue creating products that solves problems from the users.
