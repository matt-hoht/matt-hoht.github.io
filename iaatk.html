        It's All About the Kids Foundation is an non-profit organization in San Diego focus in providing nutritious food for children in impoverished neighborhoods. There are over 200 families registered for the food pantry service. Volunteers come in each week to sign families in and distribute food to them. The organization encountered a bottleneck situation during check-in each week and they do not have a reliable way in collecting and editing information for the registered families.

    <h3>
      Observing Previous System
    </h3>

    <br>

    <b2>
      The original check-in system which utilize a printed-out sign in list with family names ordered in alphabetical order and families were checked in manually one at a time. Families provide their first and last name verbally to check-in. Volunteer then locate their name on the sign-in list. Once the correct entry has been located, families are asked to sign their initial to confirm that they have received their food for the week. When food pantry closes, the director has to manually enter the data of which families have come in for that week.

  <div id="intro">
    <h3>
      System Map
    </h3>
    <br>
    <b2>
      We identify that the bottle-neck problem begins when volunteers take time to search for the entry of the families' names and when families have to repeat their name when volunteers did not quite catch it the first time. Then a line slowly begins to form. During rush hour, the line can last up to 2 minutes.

      Problems to tackle.

    <br>
    <b2>
      <ol>
        <li> Paper sign-in sheet are not durable and eco-friendly. One copy is being printed out each week limiting the sign-in process to only one location. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Volunteers have to recite the alphabetical order each time to locate the families' last name. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Repeated first and last family names and repeated entry from multiple sign-ups. </li>
        <br>
        <li> English is a second language for most families and sometimes communication comes to a halt and it takes time to explain the process through body language or a translator. </li>
        <br>
        <li> Difficult and tedious to record data and it is difficult to visualize data. </li>

              <br>
              <li>I thought that speed was the most important, as we interview more volunteers, people actually enjoy the aspect of speaking to the families who come in and have eventually form friendship during their time volunteering. </li>

            <b2>
              We initially planned to implement an QR code check-in system due to the nature of efficiency and might eliminate the slow down once families became familiar in the system and eliminates the need of communication. However, we soon realize that many clients are not familiar with what a qr code is which might discourage them from using the food pantry service.
              We decided to replace the original data sheet with a search engine. The check in process is familiar for both volunteers and families. The search engine matches searched item from the database and provides information of family size and phone number for volunteer to confirm with our clients. Implementing multiple devices allow for faster queue time.

<h1>
Tripsy, your personal Travel Itinerary
</h1>
<body>
<h2>
Introduction:
</h2>
<b1>
The topic of traveling has often been brought up among my peers during my time in college. However, there are lots of planning to do prior to going on a trip and the planning spans across doing research on different websites, tools and even books. Lots and lots of information are gathered and are often messy and unorganized. It gets even crazier when you try to organize a trip with friends. And now you might run into problems of overlapping information, having difficulty to accommodate everyone.
</b1>
<h1>
How can we create an informative yet organized travel itinerary that is easy to use which can be suitable for one person and a group of friends?
</h1>
<b2>
We want to create an easy-to-use and organized itinerary. that can organize the information for us place an emphasis on creating our own itinerary filled with places that we would like to visit. We have to utilize many different tools from research to booking different air fares to locating a place to stay and there is no one organized way of creating such itinerary.
</b2>

R&I
<h2>
Research & Assumption
</h2>
<b2>
We had a few initial assumptions on travel planning and have listed them below and hopefully create a tool that addressed these assumptions.
<ul>
<li>Having to go through different sites are tedious.</li>
<li>One person in a group does all the planning during travel.</li>
<li>People have difficulties to begin research when they don’t know where to begin.</li>
<li>They have narrowed down some criteria on how they planned the trip, trying to cut cost to make it more affordable, experiencing the lifestyle and cultures of the places they visit, and having the freedom of going to places that they really would like to go.</li>


</ul>
We then conducted personal interviews and published online survey on travel planning strategies, time it takes to conduct research, habits and behavior of people who often go on trips. And some of our assumptions are proven wrong.
<ul>
<li>Contrast to our own assumption, people enjoy a variety of options so they enjoy visiting multiple sites.</li>
<li>People tend to enjoy going to places their friends recommend over what the internet suggests.</li>
<li>People like to cut costs on food and housing by skipping a meal and sharing housing with friends. </li>
<li>Foreign public transport system can be confusing at times.</li>
<li>Prefer freedom over schedule.</li>


</ul>
</b2>

<h2>
Value Proposition

How is this valuable?
</h3>
<b2>
<ul>

</li>
<li>SAVING TIME. Allowing you to access information quickly lets you be on the go faster. In case of any emergency happens, you can quickly make a plan b using the information provided.
