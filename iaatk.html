    A bottle-necked problem is seen in a paper-trial check in system. We have visited our client's site to conduct interviews with our user base. We discovered that flipping through the physical check-in sheet takes the most time and there are volunteers idle on the side which can provide help with check-in. We have designed a system using a smart-search system where you can enter either the first name, last name or phone number to quickly record the entry of the visitor. We then incorporated a data-base so our client can make an estimation on how much food to prepare for upcoming weeks based on the entries of visitors recorded by our system.

        It's All About the Kids Foundation is an non-profit organization in San Diego focus in providing nutritious food for children in impoverished neighborhoods. There are over 200 families registered for the food pantry service. Volunteers come in each week to sign families in and distribute food to them. The organization encountered a bottleneck situation during check-in each week and they do not have a reliable way in collecting and editing information for the registered families.

      Observing Previous System

    <b2 class=noto>
      The original check-in system which utilize a printed-out sign in list with family names ordered in alphabetical order and families were checked in manually one at a time. Families provide their first and last name verbally to check-in. Volunteer then locate their name on the sign-in list. Once the correct entry has been located, families are asked to sign their initial to confirm that they have received their food for the week. When food pantry closes, the director has to manually enter the data of which families have come in for that week.

      We identify that the bottle-neck problem begins when volunteers take time to search for the entry of the families' names and when families have to repeat their name when volunteers did not quite catch it the first time. Then a line slowly begins to form. During rush hour, the line can last up to 2 minutes.

              We initially planned to implement an QR code check-in system due to the nature of efficiency and might eliminate the slow down once families became familiar in the system and eliminates the need of communication. However, we soon realize that many clients are not familiar with what a qr code is which might discourage them from using the food pantry service.
              We decided to replace the original data sheet with a search engine. The check in process is familiar for both volunteers and families. The search engine matches searched item from the database and provides information of family size and phone number for volunteer to confirm with our clients. Implementing multiple devices allow for faster queue time.
